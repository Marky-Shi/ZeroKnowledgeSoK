# Circom

We provide a development environment for [Circom](https://github.com/iden3/circom) circuits. All you have to do is make a folder for your new program and add the `.circom` and `input.json` file in a `src/` folder. You can also copy our `run_<program>.sh` scripts. This will build everything and copy it to your local computer from the Docker container.
